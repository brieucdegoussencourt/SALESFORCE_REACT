## 📖 About Richyvest

Richyvest is a simple yet powerful investment application designed to estimate returns on investments made in ETFs following the MSCI World Index. This project represents a personal milestone, as it marks the completion of my training as a **Junior Web Developer** at [beCode](https://becode.org). The project was built over three weeks in October 2024 as part of my preparation for an internship at [Easyvest](https://easyvest.be). I am proud to say that I had not worked on the techs used before starting the project and was able to quickly apprehend them in order to complete the project.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: React, React Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
- 🔗 **Backend**: Salesforce (Apex, Visualforce)  
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Salesforce Page

This stack allows for building modern, responsive web applications with robust backend integration using Salesforce.

## 🏆 Project Goals

The main purpose of this project was to:

- 🧠 Get familiar with the tech stack used at **Easyvest**
- 📈 Build a functional app that estimates returns based on the **MSCI World Index**
- 🏅 Achieve hands-on experience integrating **Salesforce** as the backend
