/**
 * The text content inside `<style>` is a special case. It is _only_ rendered by the LWC engine itself; `<style>` tags
 * are disallowed inside of HTML templates.
 *
 * The `<style>` tag is unusual in how it's defined in HTML. Like `<script>`, it is considered a "raw text element,"
 * which means that it is parsed as raw text, but certain character sequences are disallowed, namely to avoid XSS
 * attacks like `</style><script>alert("pwned")</script>`.
 *
 * This also means that we cannot use "normal" HTML escaping inside `<style>` tags, e.g. we cannot use `&lt;`,
 * `&gt;`, etc., because these are treated as-is by the HTML parser.
 *
 *
 * @param contents CSS source to validate
 * @throws Throws if the contents provided are not valid.
 * @see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#raw-text-elements
 * @see https://github.com/salesforce/lwc/issues/3439
 * @example
 * validateStyleTextContents('div { color: red }') // Ok
 * validateStyleTextContents('</style><script>alert("pwned")</script>') // Throws
